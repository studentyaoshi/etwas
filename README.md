# ETWAS
Epigenetic element-based Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies
## Introduction  
> Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) providing a powerful approach to identify novel disease risk genes and uncover possible causal genes at loci identified previously by genome-wide association study (GWAS). However, these methods did not consider the importance of epigenetic regulation in gene expression. Here, we developed a novel epigenetic element-based transcriptome-wide association study (ETWAS) that tested the effects of genetic variants on gene expression levels with the epigenetic features as prior and further mediated the association between predicted expression and complex diseases.
